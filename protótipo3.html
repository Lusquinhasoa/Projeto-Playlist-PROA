    <h1>Letra</h1>
<h3>Don't speak, no, don't try</h3>
<h3>It's been a secret for the longest time</h3>
<h3>Don't run (oh), no, don't hide</h3>
<h3>Been running from it for the longest time</h3>
<h3>So many mornings, I woke up confused</h3>
<h3>In my dreams, I do anything I want to you</h3>
<h3>My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind</h3>
<h3>Right now, I'm shameless</h3>
<h3>Screamin' my lungs out for ya</h3>
<h3>Not afraid to face it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Show me you're shameless</h3>
<h3>Write it on my neck, why don't ya?</h3>
<h3>And I won't erase it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>So we're there, now it's real</h3>
<h3>Now that you have me, do you want me still?</h3>
<h3>My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh</h3>
<h3>And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no</h3>
<h3>So many mornings I woke up confused</h3>
<h3>In my dreams, I do anything I want to you</h3>
<h3>My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (mind)</h3>
<h3>Right now, I'm shameless</h3>
<h3>Screamin' my lungs out for ya</h3>
<h3>Not afraid to face it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Show me you're shameless</h3>
<h3>Write it on my neck, why don't ya?</h3>
<h3>And I won't erase it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>There's just inches in between us</h3>
<h3>I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh</h3>
<h3>There is tension in between us</h3>
<h3>I just wanna give in</h3>
<h3>And I don't care if I'm forgiven</h3>
<h3>Right now, I'm shameless</h3>
<h3>Screamin' my lungs out for ya</h3>
<h3>Not afraid to face it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>Show me you're shameless</h3>
<h3>Write it on my neck, why don't ya?</h3>
<h3>And I won't erase it</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>I need you more than I want to</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
<h3>No, uh, uh, don't wanna do this now</h3>
