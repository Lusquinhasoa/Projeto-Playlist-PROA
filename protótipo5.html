    <h1>Letras</h1>
<h3>If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy</h3>
<h3>And I can take you for a ride</h3>
<h3>I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm</h3>
<h3>Where the music don't stop for life</h3>
<h3>Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes</h3>
<h3>Shining just the way I like</h3>
<h3>If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company</h3>
<h3>You met me at the perfect time</h3>
<h3>You want me, I want you, baby</h3>
<h3>My sugarboo, I'm levitating</h3>
<h3>The Milky Way, we're renegading</h3>
<h3>Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah</h3>
<h3>I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight</h3>
<h3>I need you all night, come on, dance with me</h3>
<h3>I'm levitating</h3>
<h3>You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)</h3>
<h3>I need you all night, come on, dance with me</h3>
<h3>I'm levitating</h3>
<h3>I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy</h3>
<h3>I see us written in the stars</h3>
<h3>We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never</h3>
<h3>Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far</h3>
<h3>Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes</h3>
<h3>Shining just the way we are</h3>
<h3>I feel like we're forever every time we get together</h3>
<h3>But whatever, let's get lost on Mars</h3>
