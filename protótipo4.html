    <h1>Letra</h1>
<h3>Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes</h3>
<h3>But it's the only thing that I know</h3>
<h3>When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes</h3>
<h3>It is the only thing makes us feel alive</h3>
<h3>We keep this love in a photograph</h3>
<h3>We made these memories for ourselves</h3>
<h3>Where our eyes are never closing</h3>
<h3>Hearts are never broken</h3>
<h3>And time's forever frozen, still</h3>
<h3>So you can keep me</h3>
<h3>Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans</h3>
<h3>Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet</h3>
<h3>You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home</h3>
<h3>Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul</h3>
<h3>And it's the only thing that I know, know</h3>
<h3>I swear it will get easier</h3>
<h3>Remember that with every piece of ya</h3>
<h3>Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die</h3>
<h3>Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph</h3>
<h3>We made these memories for ourselves</h3>
<h3>Where our eyes are never closing</h3>
<h3>Hearts were never broken</h3>
<h3>And time's forever frozen, still</h3>
<h3>So you can keep me</h3>
<h3>Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans</h3>
<h3>Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet</h3>
<h3>You won't ever be alone</h3>
<h3>And if you hurt me</h3>
<h3>That's okay, baby, only words bleed</h3>
<h3>Inside these pages, you just hold me</h3>
<h3>And I won't ever let you go</h3>
<h3>Wait for me to come home</h3>
<h3>Wait for me to come home</h3>
<h3>Wait for me to come home</h3>
<h3>Wait for me to come home</h3>
<h3>Oh, you can fit me</h3>
<h3>Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen</h3>
<h3>Next to your heartbeat where I should be</h3>
<h3>Keep it deep within your soul</h3>
<h3>And if you hurt me</h3>
<h3>Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed</h3>
<h3>Inside these pages, you just hold me</h3>
<h3>And I won't ever let you go</h3>
<h3>When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me</h3>
<h3>Under the lamppost back on Sixth street</h3>
<h3>Hearing you whisper through the phone</h3>
<h3>"Wait for me to come home"</h3>
