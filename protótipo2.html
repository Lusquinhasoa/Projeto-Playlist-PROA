    <h1>Letra</h1>
<h3>Here I am, stuck on this couch</h3>
<h3>Scrolling through my notes</h3>
<h3>Heart was broken, still no growing, nah</h3>
<h3>Waking up to headlines</h3>
<h3>Filled with devastation again</h3>
<h3>My heart is broken</h3>
<h3>But I keep going</h3>
<h3>Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate</h3>
<h3>No, I won't let it change me</h3>
<h3>Never losing sight of the one I keep inside</h3>
<h3>Now, I know it</h3>
<h3>Yeah, I know it</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today (as long as I wake up)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>It's hard to sleep at night</h3>
<h3>Oh, and what's outside?</h3>
<h3>Feeling hopeless</h3>
<h3>I need focus</h3>
<h3>You hit me with words</h3>
<h3>I never heard come out your mouth</h3>
<h3>To be honest</h3>
<h3>I don't want it, no</h3>
<h3>Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate</h3>
<h3>No, I won't let it change me</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today (as long as I wake up)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away (you can't take my youth)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away (oh, oh, yeah)</h3>
<h3>Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate</h3>
<h3>No, I won't let it change me</h3>
<h3>Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate</h3>
<h3>No, I won't let it change me</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away (youth away)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today (as long as I wake up)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away (oh, yeah)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away (oh, oh, yeah)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>This soul of mine will never break</h3>
<h3>As long as I wake up today (as long as I wake up)</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
<h3>You can't take my youth away</h3>
