    <h1>Letra</h1>
<h3>Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God</h3>
<h3>And I'm so damn grateful</h3>
<h3>'Cause you make up for all the things I'm not</h3>
<h3>Didn't know I needed nothing, 'til I needed you ('til I needed you)</h3>
<h3>In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy lettin' go</h3>
<h3>Eight billion people we just lookin' for a hand to hold</h3>
<h3>Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (hold on to)</h3>
<h3>It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave</h3>
<h3>When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong, 'cause of you at end of the day</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs somebody (everybody need somebody)</h3>
<h3>Somebody to remind you that you're not alone</h3>
<h3>Who gon' defend you like an army (defend you like an army)</h3>
<h3>And never let go (never let go)</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)</h3>
<h3>Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone</h3>
<h3>So if you need me, then you got me (if you need me, then you got me)</h3>
<h3>I'll be the shoulder you cry on</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs some-</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs somebody</h3>
<h3>Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star</h3>
<h3>It's the way you light up every room just being who you are</h3>
<h3>Didn't know I needed nothing, 'til I needed you ('til I needed you, oh, woah)</h1>
<h3>But before I met you, I never believed in magic</h1>
<h3>But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it</h3>
<h3>I know (yeah, yeah) that you know (yeah, yeah)</h3>
<h3>What we got, it don't come easy</h3>
<h3>It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave</h3>
<h3>When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong, 'cause of you at end of the day</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs somebody (everybody need somebody)</h1>
<h3>Somebody to remind you that you're not alone</h3>
<h3>Who gon' defend you like an army (defend you like an army)</h3>
<h3>And never let go (never let go)</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs somebody (everybody need somebody)</h3>
<h3>Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone</h3>
<h3>So if you need me, then you got me (if you need me, then you got me)</h1>
<h3>I'll be the shoulder you cry on</h1>
<h3>Everybody needs some-</h3>
<h3>Everybody needs some somebody</h3>
